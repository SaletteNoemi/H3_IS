In this homework, you will implement BFS and DFS for solving the missionaries and cannibals puzzle. Some extra points may be given based on the originality and quality of the submitted solution. This homework can be completed in teams of at most four people.

Three missionaries meet three hungry cannibals at the edge of a river.
Next to them is a boat that can take a maximum of two people. They must
find a sequence of crossings that allow both them and the cannibals to
cross the river safely.
        - The boat can not cross the river empty.
        - At no time should more cannibals than missionaries be left on one of 
          the banks of the river, for if that happened, the missionaries would 
          perish in the jaws of the hungry cannibals.
